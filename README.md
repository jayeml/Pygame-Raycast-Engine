# Pygame_Raycast_Engine
A raycast engine made in python with the pygame library

v0.1.0
- Initial game release
- Added level editor

v0.1.2
- Moved assets to a seprate file

v0.1.3
- Added vertical movement
- Added support to upload images
- Started adding support for multiple layers

v0.2.0
- Added sprites
- Removed multi-layer
- Removed 2D mode

To Do:
- Add floor and ceiling
- Optimize
- Add combat
- Give enemies Ai

Note:
The game is hardly playble with sprites right now and I'm not sure how to optimize it so I think I'm going to take a break from this project until mojo comes out or I think of a good way to optimize it.
